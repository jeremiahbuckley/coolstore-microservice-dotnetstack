# coolstore-microservice-dotnetstack
This is a .Net version of the coolstore-microservice project
Original here: https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/coolstore-microservice
"Forked" - Aug 14, 2019, and will presumably drift from there unless resynced.

Status:
1. cart-service - building, have to figure out how to work with drools or .net drools-alike. also, logging.
2. catalog-service - not started - have to connect to MongoDB. Doable but haven't thought about yet.
3. coolstore-gw - not started
4. coolstore-ui - not started, should not have to do
5. docs - not started
6. inventory-service - not started
7. openshift - not started, may not have to do
8. pricing-service - not started, here's the drools bit, maybe just change this to be hard-coded rules rather than drools.
9. rating-service - not started, some stuff here with fabric8, which will have to be sorted out
10. review-service - built, no automated qa built yet
11. sso-service - not started, hopefully we don't have to do anything with this
